# Dotify
This website is a music player inspired by the UI of Spotify. I used the MERN Stack as well as Redux for the Global State. Dotify is a 
fully functional Music Player using Royalty Free Music from https://pixabay.com/music/.

There is Account Verification (Using Nodemailer) & User Authentication. BcryptJS is used 
for the password Hashing.
You can create your own playlists, adjust the volume & play the music from any page.
I used Multer to store the audio files in the database and gridfs-stream to stream the music to the browser.
